        the DBGeo Decoder to decoder against.
    -->
    <!-- TOWRdocs Description
        This file contains multiple ProductDescription definitions relating to the DBGeo
        (GeoData) plugin. It is used to populate a single GeoData ProductDescription instance,
        which is then decoded to generate GeoDataRecords. Essentially this file provides the 
        framework for mapping NetCDF-4 Variables or Attributes, as well as user-defined values,
        to GeoDataRecord fields. 

        <description> - Signifies the beginning of a new ProductDescription
            "name" : The string name of the description (for debug)

        <debug> - Option allows you to specify whether or not errors (specific to that <description>)
            That are caught in the Decoder are logged in the ingest log file. This entry is useful
            for gathering more information as to why a specific <description> will not generate
            valid GeoDataRecord(s). 

        <source> - Describes the source of the product (instrument, etc.).

        <product> - Name of the product.

        <lat> - The NetCDF Variable that corresponds to the array of Latitude observations
                you are interested in.
        <lon> - The NetCDF Variable that corresponds to the array of Longitude observations
                you are interested in.

        <geomType> - The type(s) of the Geometries contained in the file (Point, Line, Polygon, etc.). 

        <geomOffset> -  The index into the lat/lon arrays where each Geometry item begins.

        <geomNels> - The number of lat/lon pairs (starting at the index from geomOffset) that each Geometry contains.

        <dataTime> - The time of observation of each Geometry in the file (in seconds since a defined epoch).

           "epoch" - The string (must be of form "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") that represents
                the epoch that the dataTimes in this file are based on
           "units" - Default, but required field. This should always be "SECONDS", as the
                dataTime variables/attributes/values are most often set as seconds from the
                dataEpoch

           <variable name="varName" /> - Use the <variable> bean when the values for observation time
                are stored in a NetCDF Variable (array) within the file.

           <attribute name="attName" /> - Use the <attribute> bean when the value for observation time
                is stored as a Global Attribute in the NetCDF File (i.e. if the observation time is uniform).

           <value value="value" /> - Use this entry if ALL observations are uniformly sampled at 
                The same observation time (i.e. a single "dataTime" for the file), and if the observation time
                is not present as a Global Attribute in the NetCDF file. 

        <atts> - Contains the list of Geometry-related information, which are NetCDF Variable/Attribute/Values.

            <geomAtt> - Signifies a new Geometry-related piece of trivia.

        NOTE : The following may be described as a NetCDF Variable or Attribute, or user-defined 
            (and constant for all Geometries in the file) Value:

                <source>
                <product>
                <geomType>
                <geomOffset>
                <geomNels
                <geomAtt>
                <dataTime>

            This is done by declaring the corresponding Variable/Attribute/Value <bean>

            NetCDF Variable : <variable name="NAME-OF-NETCDF-VAR" />
            NetCDF Attribute : <attribute name="NAME-OF-NETCDF-ATT" />
            Constant Value : <value value="VALUE" />
