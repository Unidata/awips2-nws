# Sample template Configuration information for bin lightning AES cipher
# Per design review discussions, the default location to look for this file is external to AWIPS II tree at /usr/local/ldm 
# 
#   properties include:
#       binlightning.AESKeystore: the java keystore that store AES cipher key or keys (if ever vendors changes keys in the future)
#                                 Keystore type should be JCEKS, and the key aliases should be prefixed with date in the format of yyyy-MM-dd so 
#                                 that if more than one keys found, the latest key will be tried first.
#                                 The keystore should not be distributed with AWIPS II and should be protected by a store password
#
#       binlightning.AESKeystorePassword: the password for the keystore  
#
#   The above properties could be overwritten by system properties, e.g., through -D options in EDEX startup script
#
# NOTE: since the key is not supposed to release with the source and rpm files, the program has built two ways for you 
#       to specify keystore and key pass information:
#       1. Use binlightning.aeskeypropfile system property (e.g., -D option on command line) to specify location of a valid properties file 
#          to overwrite the default location of this file (/usr/local/ldm/BinLightningAESKey.properties).
#          When binlightning.aeskeypropfile system property is used, other -D options (as listed below in 2) are ignored.  
#       2. Use system properties (e.g., -D optinos on command line) to overwrite binlightning.AESKeystore & binlightning.AESKeystorePassword properties
#

#
# sample, self-generated key, safe to distribute
#
binlightning.AESKeystore=/usr/local/ldm/binLightningTestKeystore.jce
binlightning.AESKeystorePassword=testStorePass

#
# production key, do not distribute keystore and password 
#
#binlightning.AESKeystore=/usr/local/ldm/binLightningAESKeystore.jce
#binlightning.AESKeystorePassword=notShownHere

#
# The WMO Header string to determine if bit-shifted data is GLD360 data: binlightning.gld360WMOHeaderStartString  
# By default or when this is not set, the bit-shifted data will not set the lightning source (which defaults to NLDN in database table column)
# Normally, SFPA41 denotes GLD360, SFPA99 is test GLD360 data  
# Added 12/24/2013, WZ
# 
binlightning.gld360WMOHeaderStartString=SFPA
