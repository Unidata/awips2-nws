<b>MASTER CLIMATE GUI</b> <a href = climate_master.gif> (Click here to see GUI)</a> Listed are options found on the Master Climate GUI. Please select from the following:<br>
<br>
<a href= climo_prefs.html>Configure Climate Parameters</a> - used to change parameters
which affect all of climate. Editing of the Valid Time for evening reports, the Climate Master Station table,
the Alternate Annual Periods, and the format of NWWS output products all occur via this option.<br><br>
<a href= report_format.html>Set Up/Edit Climate Products</a> - allows the user to 
select the type of report and the parameters for the output product. This 
includes the product ID, periodicity, effective and expiration times, listening 
area code (LAC), the stations for which a product will be generated, and all of 
the output options for the product (i.e., weather elements and report periods). It is
also used to view the properties of products which already exist and delete product 
ID's that are no longer needed.<br><br>
<a href= execute_AM_PM_climate.html>Execute Climate</a> - Six run options exist: <i>Daily Morning, Daily Intermediate,
Daily Evening, Monthly, Seasonal, and Annual</i>. Once one of these options is
selected, an icon appears notifying that Climate is running. After the climate data is 
derived, an icon will appear next to <b>Edit Climate Data</b> on the Monitoring 
Control window. The user can then click 'Edit Climate Data' which will bring up 
the new climate data.<br><br>
<a href= f6.html>Create F6 Products</a> - is used to create F6 output products for all stations
in the master station list for a chosen month.<br><br>
<a href= initialize_climate.html>Initialize Climate Database</a> - is used to manually enter or import recorded climatological data which includes both daily and monthly normal data.<br><br>
<a href= edit_data.html>Quality Control Climate Database</a> - allows the user to edit climate data that is already stored in the database.<br><br><br>
<b><I>Clicking the menu bar "help" on individual GUI's while running climate will give help for that particular GUI.</I></b>
