This option provides a tabular depiction of the climate data for a chosen month.
The first option is to create the F6 product for the current month through the
current day. The other option is to create a product for a previous month by
selecting the desired month from the option menu and entering the year into
the year field.
<br><br>

From the station list on the right, select the stations for which an F6 is to be
generated. They can be printed to the local printer by checking the <b>Print
selected F6s</b> button. The products will be output into the text database 
with the PIL SSSLCDMMM, where SSS represents the three-letter station id and MMM
is the three-letter month <i>(ex. Pittsburgh's F6 for the month of March would 
be saved as PITLCDMAR)</i>
