<a name="valid"><br>
<h3><b>Valid Time</b></h3>
The <b>Valid Time for Daily Evening Reports</b> and <b>Valid Time for Daily
Intermediate Reports</b> are used to define a cut-off time for finding the 
maximums, minimums, and sums for their respective daily climatological report. 
There are two ways to define the valid times: use the product creation time or
set a fixed local time. For example, if an evening report is desired and the 
valid time is set to "As Of 5 P.M.", data for the station(s) will be parsed 
beginning with midnight local time through 5 P.M. for the current day. On the 
other hand, if the "Time of Climate Run" is selected, the report will contain
data from midnight through the time that climate is executed.<br><br>

<h3><b>NOTES/CAUTIONS</h3></b>
<ul>
<IMG align=left SRC="dotblue.gif"></a>Climate defaults to the "Time of Climate
Run" for the valid time if climate is executed before the user-defined "As Of" 
time. For example, if the cron automatically runs at 3:30 PM and a valid time of 
5:00 PM is chosen, the product will state that the report is valid as of 3:00 PM 
(the latest hourly observations).</ul><br><br>

<a name="stations"><br>
<h3><b>Station List</b></h3>
<a href = select_stations.gif> (Click here to see GUI) </a><br><br>

<b>Station List</b>- This list contains the stations available for the 
climatological products.<br><br>

To edit the list, simply type a four-letter identifier in an empty station ID
box. The name of the station will appear as stored in the database. If an 
identifier is not found, <i><b>Invalid ID</b></i> will appear in the associated
name box.<br><br>

The <b>Std Time All Year</b> box should be checked if a station remains on
standard time year-round.<br><br>

Oftentimes, long station names have been abbreviated in the database and ASOS
stations appear with the word ASOS attached. These cause complications when 
used in a NOAA Weather Radio product to be read by the CRS. Therefore, the name
fields are editable.<br><br>

<b>Save Stations</b> saves the stations and any changes made for use by the climate
application only.<br><br>

One note, when a station with an edited name is deleted, if retrieval is desired
again, the name will have to be edited again.<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<a name="report"><br>
<h3><b>Reporting Periods</b></h3>
<a href = report_periods.gif> (Click here to see GUI) </a><br><br>

<b>Reporting Periods</b> - These three fields determine the portion of the year
that snow, heating degree days, and cooling degree days appear in the climate
product.<br><br>

If the current date falls outside of the periods for any of these elements, it
will override any selection made via the report format GUI. For example, if the
heating degree days were chosen to be displayed for a product, the current date
is July 1, and the reporting period is from Sep. 1 to May 1, the heating degree
days will not appear in the final output since the current date falls outside the
reporting period.<br><br>

The reporting periods are product specific, meaning they can be set to different 
dates for each climate product.<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<a name="annual"><br>
<h3><b>Alternate Annual (Seasonal) Periods</b></h3>
<a href = annual_periods.gif> (Click here to see GUI) </a><br><br>

<b>Alternate Annual Period (Season)</b> - This interface sets the begin date for
the season-to-date totals of snow and liquid precipitation.<br><br> 

Year-to-date totals for all elements are fixed and cannot be changed. They are
as follows:<br><br>
<center><table width="80%">
<tr><td><b>Heating Degree Days:</b></td> <td>July 1 - June 30</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Cooling Degree Days:</b></td> <td>January 1 - December 31</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Snow:</b></td> <td>July 1 - June 30</tr></td>
<tr><td><b>Precipitation:</b></td> <td>January 1 - December 31</tr></td>
</table></center><br>

Some stations might be better suited by an alternate annual period. For example,
a station's wet season might occur from the middle of December to the end of January.
An alternate period of March to March might be better suited to keep breaking the wet
season apart into two separate yearly sums.<br><br>

If this is not necessary, the other option is to use the <i><b>Current 3 Month Season</i></b>
 for a station. This results in season-to-date sums beginning with the first day
of a defined season.<br><br>

<center><table width="80%">
<tr><td><u>Current Month</u></td><td><u>Season Start Date</u></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Dec., Jan., or Feb.</b></td><td>December 1</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Mar., Apr., or May</b></td><td>March 1</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Jun., Jul., or Aug.</b></td><td>June 1</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Sep., Oct., or Nov.</b></td><td>September 1</td></tr>
</table></center><br>

The seasonal sums for the degree days cannot be changed and are always summed in
the three month intervals described above. Any changes made to the snow and 
precipitation dates made via this interface will only appear in the final output 
if the season-to-date total has been chosen.<br><br>

Note that any changes made will affect <i>all</i> products including those already
created.<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<a name="thresholds"><br>
<h3><b>Edit User-Defined Values / Change Threshold Values</b></h3>
<a href = usr_defined_values.gif> (Click here to see GUI) </a><br><br>
<B>Edit User-Defined Values</B> - This interface allows the user to set specific threshold values
to Maximum and Minimum Temperature, Precipitation amount, and Snowfall amount.<br><br>

The number of days reaching or crossing the threshold value will be reported in the final
output.<BR><BR>
<b><i>Existing monthly, seasonal, and annual climate data will not be automatically
regenerated with the new thresholds.</i></b><br><br>
What in the world does this warning mean?! If new thresholds are entered and the
<b><i>Save</i></b> button is pushed, this cryptic warning appears. It means that any
existing monthly, seasonal, and annual data run with the previous threshold
value will remain the same and not be automatically updated for the new value.
This means that all monthly data will have to be regenerated if an end of the
year report is desired and the threshold values have changed during the year.
Likewise, if the values change during the middle of a season and a seasonal report
is needed, the three months of data will have to be regenerated by the user.
