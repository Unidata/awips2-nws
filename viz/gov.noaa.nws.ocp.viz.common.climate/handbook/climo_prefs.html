<b>Climate Preferences GUI</b>- <a href = climo_prefs.gif>(Click here to see
GUI)</a><br><br>

The purpose of this interface is to configure the climate parameters which affect
<i>all</i> products ouput by the application.<br><br>

The <a href = configs.html#valid>Valid Time for Daily Evening Reports</a> is used
in daily evening reports only. It defines the latest hour for which data is parsed
for the evening daily climatological reports.<br><br>

The <a href = configs.html#valid>Valid Time for Daily Intermediate Reports</a> is
identical to the valid time for evening reports except that it applies
to intermediate daily products.<br><br>

In the middle portion of the interface are three buttons:<br>
<ul><li><a href = configs.html#stations>Set Up Climate Stations</a></li>
<li><a href = configs.html#annual>Edit Alternate Annual (Seasonal) Periods</a></li>
<li><a href = configs.html#threshold>Edit User-Defined Thresholds </a></li>
</ul>

The <b>NWWS Product Format</b> section formats the appearance of all 
NOAA Weather Wire climate products.<br><br>

The <b>Save</b> button saves the NWWS format section and the valid times. <i>Any changes
made to the station list or the alternate annual periods must be saved within 
their respective GUI's.</i><br><br>

Choosing <b>Cancel</b> from the preferences interface will not override changes
made and saved for the station list or the annual periods.<br><br>
